# BrittleMPM
An implementation of Damage Field Gradient Partitioning with various damage models for dynamic brittle fracture simulation.

# Running BrittleMPM
Navigate to the examples folder and either run a test file directly, for example:
python3 circleExplode.py
Or run examples through the convenient scripting interface in controlCenter2D.py! This allows for overnight wedging for parameter tuning as well as locking in good parameters for later reproduction.
